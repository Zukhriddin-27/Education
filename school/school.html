                cover programs from kindergarten to grade 12 (age 5 to 18). In
                other words, we are a complete online educational system for

              <p>
                Education World Wide is a private school registered in the
                Florida Department of Education, United States of America. Our

                In addition, the curriculum is completely accredited in the
                United States of America, by the State of Florida, and by
                Cognia. As an added benefit, the program is approved by the NCAA
                (National College Athletic Association in the USA) as
                nontraditional core-course legislation. That means our students
                have an opportunity to get a sports scholarship from US colleges
                in NCAA Divisions. All documents issued by the Education World
                Wide school are accepted and recognized worldwide.

              <h1>How K12 Online School Works?</h1>
              <p>
                At Education World Wide, students learn through an online
                learning platform, and they also have live online classes with
                teachers and tutors. K12 online schooling is different from
                traditional schools in so many ways, but it has many benefits.
                Our students can create an individual learning plan, learn at
                their own pace and get high-quality knowledge. Online schools
                offer flexible schedules for learning. Students don’t lack
                social interaction, thanks to the group and individual online
                classes. <br /><br />

                The school year at EduWW begins whenever the student wants. We
                don’t follow the regular school calendar, and we have open
                enrollments throughout the entire year. That means that you can
                enroll or transfer any time of the year. Regardless of when the
                student enrolls, they will get ten months to complete the grade.
                <br /><br />
                Our K12 online curriculum has a strong base in the following
                subjects: English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Sciences,
                and Science. Students have these four core subjects every year,
                but the program is adapted and upgrades in each grade level.
                Besides that, the curriculum also has elective subjects, and our
                students get to choose two electives per year. Through
                electives, they get to explore personal interests and learn
                about things they are passionate about.

                <span>The Platform and Self-Paced Learning</span>
                The online learning environment enables students to learn at
                their own pace. That is one of the major differences in
                comparison to traditional schooling. A student can learn at a
                personal tempo, mostly thanks to a virtual learning platform.
                The platform is a learning management system, and each student
                has a personal profile. Once they enroll, teachers will add
                learning material for specific grades to the student’s profile.
                <br /><br />

                A student can access all lessons and assignments in each subject
                24/7. That enables them to learn whenever they want and for as
                long as they wish. At the same time, the platform measures the
                progress of students. He or she can see anytime how far they’ve
                come and what awaits them in the following days.
                <br />
                With so many features, it is hard to explain the platform in
                words, so if you are curious to see how it looks like, you can
                book a meeting with our consultant, and they can do the platform
                presentation. K12 Online School can be a good fit for students
                of all ages, but it does require different study habits which
                are not hard to establish. As a matter of fact, they are
                intuitive and come naturally for many students.

                <span>Online Classes and Tutoring Support</span>
                While learning only in the platform will suffice, Education
                World Wide also offers live online classes. Therefore, they can
                arrange full-time online schooling by combining online classes
                and learning on the platform. We believe that having a tutor or
                teacher will vastly improve a student’s online learning
                experience. Our teachers have an individual approach to each
                child and adjust teaching styles to students’ needs.
                <br /><br />
                Our school offers two types of online classes — individual and
                group. Individual classes are one on one sessions with a tutor
                that a student can book whenever they like. Group classes enable
                students to connect with their peers in a virtual environment
                and work in a group. These classes are monitor and led by
                teachers. Group classes have predetermined timetables, but as a
                school that works with international students, we try to cover
                all time zones.

                <span> Observer Account For Parents </span>
                Even though it is an online school, we make sure that parents
                are involved. They can monitor every step of their child’s
                education in their own time, as well. If a parent requests so,
                we can create an observer account on the platform, through which
                they can monitor their child’s progress.
                <br /><br />
                Likewise, parents are free to book a short consultation with a
                tutor and get a better insight into their child’s schooling. At
                the same time, our tutors send feedback to parents addressing
                potential issues that a student has and suggesting a solution on
                how to work on them.
